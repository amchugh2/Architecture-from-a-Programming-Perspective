PLEASE READ BELOW!!

I recieved a 40 on project1 and cannot drop any other projects. I've spent hours working on this, going to office hours and emailing Professor Umrigar.

I would really apprciate if you looked at my code and gave me more credit than a 40 for the work that I have put into this.

I cannot figure out my seg fault on line 63.

I've worked really REALLY hard in this class the entire semester and need to pass to graduate on time next year. Thank you so much!

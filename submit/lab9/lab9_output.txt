Lab9 Output

Exercize 2:
The mask is 0x7fffff

The mask returns the last 6 bytes of the arg (except the most significant bit of the most significant byte).

Mask was found using
objdump -d mystery.o > mystery.objdump

Mask was found in the line

and	$0x7fffff, %eax

Which is the only bitwise operation in the file, so it must be the mask.


Exercize 4:
Used command
p *(const char ***)($rbp - 16)

to print out
$16 = (const char **) 0x7fffffffeab5

value of who (hello arg)
